## 📖 Project Description
 
Quoridor AI is a complete implementation of the abstract strategy board game **Quoridor**, originally invented by Mirko Marchesi (1997) and winner of the Mensa Mind Game award. The game is played on a 9×9 board where two players race to move their pawn to the opposite side while strategically placing walls to block their opponent. This project implements the full ruleset, a graphical user interface, and an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## ✨ Implemented Features
 
1. **Full Quoridor Ruleset:** Complete 2-player implementation including orthogonal pawn movement, wall placement, jump-over mechanics, and diagonal fallback moves.
2. **Wall Validation:** Walls cannot overlap, cross, or completely block a player's path — enforced via a pathfinding check on every placement attempt.
3. **Human vs. Human Mode:** Two players can play locally on the same machine.
4. **Human vs. Computer Mode:** Play against an AI opponent.
5. **AI Opponent:** A computer opponent that evaluates future game states and selects optimal moves.
6. **Valid Move Highlighting:** Legal moves are highlighted on the board to guide the player.
7. **Game State Visualization:** The board, pawns, walls, turn indicator, and wall counts are all displayed in real time.
8. **Winner Announcement & Game Reset:** The game detects win conditions and allows the player to restart.

## 🤖 AI Algorithm
 
The computer opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**:
 
- **Minimax** builds a game tree of possible future moves, assuming both players play optimally. The AI maximizes its own advantage while minimizing the opponent's.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** cuts off branches of the game tree that cannot influence the final decision, significantly reducing computation time and allowing a deeper search depth.
- **Heuristic Evaluation** uses the difference in shortest path lengths (via BFS/Dijkstra) between the two players as the board evaluation score — the AI favors positions where its path to the goal is shorter than the opponent's.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design
 
The project is separated into three clean layers:
 
| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Game Logic** | Board state, move validation, wall placement, win detection |
| **AI Engine** | Minimax tree search, Alpha-Beta pruning, heuristic evaluation |
| **GUI / Presentation** | Board rendering, user input, game state display |
 
This separation ensures the AI and game logic can be tested independently of the interface.

 ## 🚀 How to Play / Run the Game

You can run Quoridor AI either by downloading the standalone executable (no installation required) or by running the Python source code directly.

### Option 1: Play Immediately 
If you just want to play the game without installing Python or any dependencies:
1. Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** section on the right side of this GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest `Quoridor_AI.exe` file.
3. Double-click the downloaded file to play immediately!

---

### Option 2: Run from Source (For Developers)
If you want to view, edit, or run the raw Python code, ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) installed on your system.

1. **Clone and navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/amrrnagy/Quoridor_AI.git](https://github.com/amrrnagy/Quoridor_AI.git)
   cd Quoridor_AI
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended):**
   This keeps your project dependencies isolated from your global Python installation.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate on Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Execute the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🤖 AI Usage Declaration
 
In accordance with the course guidelines, we transparently declare our use of AI tools throughout this project.
 
### Tools Used
- **Claude ** — used for brainstorming architecture, improving documentation, and structuring the README.
- **Gemini ** — used for learning concepts related to Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, and pathfinding algorithms.
### What AI Was Used For
- Brainstorming the overall architecture and separation of concerns between game logic, AI, and GUI.
- Learning and clarifying AI concepts (Minimax depth limits, heuristic design, Alpha-Beta pruning efficiency).
- Debugging logic errors in wall validation and pathfinding.
- Improving the structure and wording of this README .
### What Was Modified or Rejected
- AI-suggested Minimax implementations were reviewed and rewritten to fit our specific board representation and heuristic scoring function.
- Some suggested heuristics (e.g., pure distance-to-goal) were replaced after testing showed they caused poor AI decisions near walls — we added a wall-count factor to the evaluation.
- README and report sections generated by AI were edited to reflect our actual implementation accurately.
### Example Where AI Output Was Not Fully Correct
When we asked an AI tool to generate the wall placement validation logic, it produced a check that only prevented walls from overlapping but did not verify that a valid path still existed for both players after placement. This is a core rule of Quoridor. We identified the gap ourselves, understood why the path-blocking check is necessary (a player must always have a route to their goal), and implemented a BFS-based reachability check that runs after every attempted wall placement.
 
### What the Group Understood and Implemented Themselves
The complete game ruleset, board representation, pathfinding, Minimax search tree, Alpha-Beta pruning, GUI rendering, and all integration between layers were designed, written, and debugged by the group. AI tools were used strictly as a learning and productivity aid — every line of submitted code was read, understood, and verified by a team member before inclusion.
